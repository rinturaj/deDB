<h1 style="text-align:center;font-size: bold"> deDB </h1>


deDB is a decentralized database built using TypeScript. It utilizes a distributed architecture and peer-to-peer communication to provide a secure and fault-tolerant database solution. deDB allows for data to be stored and retrieved without the need for a centralized server or intermediary.

## Features
- Distributed architecture
- Peer-to-peer communication
